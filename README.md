A very simple and basic console application that performs a screen flashing GDI payload, and the user is allowed to choose the times of flashing and delay. This is written by me, completely in C Programming. Unfortunately, this program is only able to run on the stupid Microsoft Windows, from Windows XP to Windows 11, 32-bit or 64-bit, on all versions and editions. Just make sure that your Windows itself is working, haha.

Please do not steal it and claim that it is your own work. Respect my code. =)
